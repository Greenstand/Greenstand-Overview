**Acceptance Criteria:**

* A token or set of tokens can be sent via a web link.
* Users with access to the link can claim the token.
* Release: Version 1.2

**Token Tax System**

* Implement a tax on all minted and traded tokens.

**Buy Token Function**

* Allow users to purchase tokens.

**Sell Token Function**

* Allow users to sell tokens.

**Freeze Function**

(Functionality details not provided)

**MVP 1.2 (Requires Keycloak Integration)**

Unregistered users can create a sub-account under a managed wallet by following these steps:

1. Accessing the wallet link.
2. Selecting "create new account."
3. Entering email, password, and wallet handle name.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* User can create a new account.
* User can create a "non-trust relationship" send request to any other wallet.
