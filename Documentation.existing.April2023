Documentation.md calls for "Indexing and auditing the status of all existing documentation"

To that end, here is a list of documentation repos, directories, websites, etc.
Let's continue to add to and annotate this list in order to track the status of documents.
Is a document up-to-date? Relocated to this repo? Discarded? etc.
(This list includes the sources listed in issue 18 of the now-deprecated
[greenstand-documentation repo] (https://github.com/Greenstand/greenstand-documentation/issues/18))
