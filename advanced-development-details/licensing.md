# Licensing

At Greenstand we make heavy use of the GPL public licenses for our source codes.

Some general overview information on differences between licenses can be found here: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-open-source-licenses-work-and-how-to-add-them-to-your-projects-34310c3cf94/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-open-source-licenses-work-and-how-to-add-them-to-your-projects-34310c3cf94/)

TODO: Update this space with more details and discussion about GPL v2, v3, and Affero license variants, and how to leverage these licenses in open source.
