# Welcome to Greenstand Documentation
 
<details><summary>About Greenstand</summary>
  
  
Greenstand’s mission is to develop and maintain a global, open-source marketplace to digitally track and compensate farmers for growing individually managed trees to support reforestation and alleviate poverty. Our goal is to create a self-sustaining, forest restoration platform that connects local communities in developing countries with socially - and environmentally - concerned global citizens. Restoration efforts are informed, and adjusted, based on the results of basic ecological research. We aim to enable communities to become stewards of their land while providing opportunities for gainful employment.

Since 2015, Greenstand, a U.S.-based 501(c)(3), has continued to be one of the only organizations using a “pay to grow” model. In typical carbon funds, the benefits do not flow down to the growers, and individuals are not paid for carbon sequestration or growing trees. With our open-source Treetracker software stack, tree growers can track the trees they plant and care for in exchange for fair monetary compensation, eliminating the need to degrade natural resources to put food on the table.

## Documentation Project Background:

Greenstand has grown to include hundreds of integrating organizations, thousands of volunteer contributors, and millions of trees recorded by thousands of growers. These are our three core audiences.

Currently, Greenstand's systems and operations have grown so large and widespread that without documentation and clear communications, most of the people engaged with the project get frustrated, lose interest, and disengage. To continue up the growth curve, advancing the project documentation is critical!

Over the years we have made many attempts to solve these documentation challenges, including significant efforts made by experienced technical writers and project leads. However, time and again, Greenstand documentation issues have been sidelined, as the work needs a fully focused team of contributors working for a six-month period.

**Greenstand is seeking a grant to help solve this issue.**

## Core Documentation Problems

1. Existing documentation is scattered and hard to find. For example, there are many "How to use the app" videos, but their locations are often hard to find when the videos are needed. 
2. Findable documentation is outdated and lacks a structure and protocol to update or remove it. Contributors often ask, for example, "Which version is the wallet API documentation written for?" or "Does the Webmap API Documentation reflect the domain migration?"
3. Contributors are not able to edit and update documentation. For example, many outdated documents are locked on Google Drive or Gitbook, or pinned as a pdf in Slack. 
4. There is no standard way of documenting at Greenstand, and often the result is each lead using their own method. For example, repositories may have a Read Me, a wiki, a Gitbook page, or may have no documentation at all.

# Documentation Project

## Core Deliverables

1. Single Documentation Portal
2. Consolidated and up-to-date project documentation for all stakeholders
3. Sustainable processes for maintaining documentation.

### Project Scope
The scope of this documentation project includes: 
1. Indexing and auditing the status of all existing documentation
2. Bringing the documentation into a standardized and editable format and following the [DPG standard opensource best practices](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/publicgoods-candidates/blob/main/help-center/documentation.md) 
4. Removing old and irrelevant documentation
5. Updating and standardizing all project-critical documentation

### Out of Scope
 - Ongoing management of documentation - successful orchestration of this project will create a self-sustaining framework
 - Creating new marketing content

#### Budget Notes: 
1. 78% of this budget is allocated to stipends for technical writers, many of whom are already Greenstand volunteers.
2. Technical writers include all persons writing documentation, such as engineers and technical leaders who are documenting code, and/or otherwise creating project documentation; tech leaders whose input and involvement are critical in the review and validation of the documentation surrounding this complex microservice platform; and communication professionals with expertise in writing clear, concise, and consistent communications for specific audience needs.
3. A portion of the funds will be used to purchase Greenstand Tokens (tokens linked to sponsored trees), which will be purchased from farmers and allocated to volunteers for contributing to the documentation.

## Metrics
