# Welcome to Greenstand Documentation
 
<details><summary>About Greenstand</summary>
  
  
Greenstand’s mission is to develop and maintain a global, open-source marketplace to digitally track and compensate farmers for growing individually managed trees to support reforestation and alleviate poverty. Our goal is to create a self-sustaining restoration platform that connects local communities in developing countries with socially- and environmentally-concerned global citizens. Restoration efforts are informed, and adjusted, based on the results of basic ecological research. We aim to enable communities to become stewards of their land while providing opportunities for gainful employment.

Since 2015, Greenstand, a U.S.-based 501(c)(3), has continued to be one of the only organizations using a “pay to grow” model. In typical carbon funds the benefits do not flow down to the growers, and individuals are not paid for carbon sequestration or growing trees. With our open source Treetracker software stack, tree growers can track the trees they plant and care for in exchange for fair monetary compensation, eliminating the need to degrade natural resources to put food on the table. 

The Treetracker platform is open-source, meaning that the source code behind it is open for other developers to emulate and improve upon. For example, our Web Map is supported by Leaflet, another open-source developer. The beauty of open-source technology is that Greenstand did not have to create our Web Map and other components of the Treetracker from scratch. And we are able to share knowledge with other organizations, thus saving time and money.

## Documentation Project Back Ground:

The project has grown to hundreds of integrating organizations, thousands of contributors, and millions of trees from thousands of growers. The three core audiences interacting, using or contributing to the platform, are integrating organizations, growers and contributors.

Currently, Greenstand's systems and operations have grown so large and widespread that without documentation and clear communications helping to lead the way, most of the people in our three core audiences get frustrated, lose interest, and disengage. To continue up the growth curve, advancing the project documentation is most critical!

There have been many attempts to solve these documentation challenges including significant efforts from experienced technical writers, and project leads. However, time and again, Greenstand documentation issues have been labeled as "Needing a fully focused team of contributor for 6 months"

**Greenstand is seeking a grant to help solve this issue.**

## Core Documentation Problems

1. Existing documentation is scattered and hard to find. Example: there are many how to use the app videos, but where are they? 
2. Findable documentation is outdated, and lacking a structure and protocol to update or remove it. Example: Which version is the wallet api documentation written for? Is the Webmap API Documentation reflecting the domain migration?
3. Contributors are not able to edit and update documentation. Example: many outdated documents are locked on Google Drive or Gitbook, or pinned as a pdf in Slack. 
4. There is no standard way of documenting at Greenstand, each lead is using their own method. Example, a repositories may have a Read Me, a wiki, a Gitbook page, or many have no documentation at all.

# Documentation Project

## Core Deliverables

1. Single Documentation Portal
2. Consolidated and up-to-date project documentation for all stakeholders
3. Sustainable processes for maintaining documentation.

### Project Scope
The scope of this documentation problem includes: 
1. Indexing and auditing the status of all existing documentation.
2. Bringing the documentation into a standardized and editable format and following the [DPG standard opensource best practices](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/publicgoods-candidates/blob/main/help-center/documentation.md) 
4. Removing's old and irrelevant documentation
5. Brining all project critical documentation up to standard

### Out of Scope
 - Ongoing management of documentation - successful orchestration of this project will create a self-sustaining framework
 - Creating new marketing content
 
 ### Activities

| Action  | Timeline | Deliverable |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Recruit and Appoint Documentation Project Lead and Project Manager  | Week 1 | Appointment of a Project Lead and Project Manager | 
| Complete inventory of existing documentation | Week 2| MD file on Github with links and descriptions of all documentation|
| Perform audit of Greenstand’s existing information and documentation. Include what exists now, where located, updates needed, gaps and enhancement opportunities. | Week 2 - 6 | Adding document status to the MD file on Github with links and descriptions of all documentation.
| Research options and best practices for Documentation structure | Week 2 | Create a publicly accessible and linked road map file.
| Identify and articulate needs/wants/desires for each of Greenstand’s three core audiences. | Weeks 2-3 | MD file on Github containing research findings, current project state and suggestions |
| Identify problem areas and outline current process for onboarding core audiences. | Weeks 2-3 | MD file on Github with links to relevant onboarding files, recommend enhancements, additions/deletions and processes for making updates ongoing |
| Create roadmap, identify tasks, milestones, risks, full scope and key players required for implementation of documentation project. | Week 3-6 | Publicly viable road map with open tickets and tickets assigned to individual contributors. |
Project Management "project board set up | Week 2-6 | Using audit findings to create tickets, log dependencies, and assign tasks.|

| Communicate as necessary to raise awareness of new portal and explain process for document migration. | Week 7-24 | Migrated documents.
| Consolidate/migrate documentation, including archiving documentation and repositories that are old, outdated, or obsolete. | Week 6 - 24| Clear and accurate documentation.


## Project Budget

| Item | Number | Total | Weeks |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Technical Writers Stipend | 9  | $11700| 20 Weeks |
| Greenstand Tokens for Documentation Rewards| 4000 | $800| 24 Weeks |
| Project Manager Stipend | 1 | $1000 | 24 Weeks |
| Administrative overhead and support team |1 | $1500 | 24 weeks |
| **Total Project Cost**| | **$15,000.00**|

#### Budget Notes: 
1. 78% of this budget is allocated to stipends for volunteer Technical Writers.
2. Technical Writers include all persons writing documentation, including engineers and technical leaders who are documenting code, creating project documentation, and tech leaders whose input and involvement is critical in the review and validation of documentation surrounding this complex microservice platform.
3. Greenstand Tokens, (tokens linked to sponsored) will be purchased from farmers and allocated to volunteer contributors for contributing to documentation.
